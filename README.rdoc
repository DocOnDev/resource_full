ResourceFull
==============

ResourceFull is a subclass of ActionController intended to provide a 
comprehensive resource modeling and querying framework.  It allows for
abstracted handling of queryable parameters, a separation of controller
concerns into multiple submethods, handling of respondable formats,
and XML serialization of the actual notion of a resource itself for
metadata handling purposes.  It's similar to resource_this, but more 
opinionated and eventually more comprehensive.

Methods may be easily overwritten in subclasses at any pain point to provide
custom behaviors for renders and CRUD behavior.

Example
=======

  class UsersController < ResourceFull::Base
    identified_by :username
    
    queryable_with :city, :state, :from => :address
    queryable_with :name, :columns => [:first_name, :last_name]
    queryable_with :email_address, :fuzzy => true
    
    responds_to :html
    responds_to :xml, :only => [:read, :update]
  end
  
  class AddressesController < ResourceFull::Base
    nests_within :users
    queryable_with :city, :state
  end

This allows for the following:

  /users/bguthrie.xml
  /users?name=Guthrie
  /users?email_address=gmail
  /users.xml?city=Chicago&name=Brian,Paul,Alicia
  /users/bguthrie/addresses

  >> UsersController.to_xml
  => "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<resource>\n  <parameters type=\"array\"/>..."
