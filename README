ActionResource
==============

ActionResource is a subclass of ActionController intended to provide a 
comprehensive resource modelling and querying framework.  It automatically
sets up ActiveRecord querying based on controller name and establishes an
API for tweaking the behavior of a resource at a high level.  It's similar
to resource_this but more opinionated and eventually more comprehensive.

Methods may be easily overwritten in subclasses at any pain point to provide
custom behaviors for renders and CRUD behavior.

Example
=======

class Users
  queryable_with :address_id, :first_name, :last_name
  nests :addresses
end
