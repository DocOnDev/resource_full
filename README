ActionResource
==============

ActionResource is a subclass of ActionController intended to provide a 
comprehensive resource modeling and querying framework.  It allows for
abstracted handling of queryable parameters, a separation of controller
concerns into multiple submethods, handling of respondable formats,
and XML serialization of the actual notion of a resource itself for
metadata handling purposes.  It's similar to resource_this, but more 
opinionated and eventually more comprehensive.

Methods may be easily overwritten in subclasses at any pain point to provide
custom behaviors for renders and CRUD behavior.

Example
=======

  class UsersController < ActionResource::Base
    self.resource_identifier = :username

    queryable_with :address_id, :first_name, :last_name
    queryable_with :email_address, :fuzzy => true
    nests :addresses
    responds_to :html, :xml
  end

This allows for the following:

  /users/bguthrie
  /users?email_address=gmail
  /users.xml?address_id=1&first_name=Brian
  /users/bguthrie/addresses

  >> UsersController.to_xml
  => "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<resource>\n  <parameters type=\"array\"/>..."
